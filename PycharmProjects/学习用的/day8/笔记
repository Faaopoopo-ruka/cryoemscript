静态方法
    与类无关，不能访问类里的任何属性和方法
类方法
    只能访问类变量
属性@property
    把一个方法变成一个静态属性，
    flight.status
    @status.setter
    flight.status = 3
    @status.delter

    getattr(obj,str)
    setattr(obj,str,val)
    hasattr(obj,str)
    delattr(obj,str)

__new__
class Foo(object):
    def __call__()
        print"call"

Foo()() #执行call方法

__metaclass__ 用来定义这个类以怎样的形式被创建

try
    ...
except (ValueError,KeyError),e  #in 2.7
except (ValueError,KeyError) as e : 3.x

except Exception as e:放在异常处理最后面，

else: #没发生异常，就执行

finally, 无论如何都执行

raise ValueError

断言
assert type(obj.name) is int
print(obj.name /2)

First, you must create a request handler处理类 class by subclassing the BaseRequestHandler class and overriding覆盖 its handle() method; this method will process incoming requests. 　　
你必须自己创建一个请求处理类，并且这个类要继承BaseRequestHandler,并且还有重写父亲类里的handle()
Second, you must instantiate实例化 one of the server classes, passing it the server’s address and the request handler class.
你必须实例化TCPServer ，并且传递server ip 和 你上面创建的请求处理类 给这个TCPServer
Then call the handle_request() or serve_forever() method of the server object to process one or many requests.
server.handle_request() #只处理一个请求
server.serve_forever() #处理多个一个请求，永远执行


Finally, call server_close() to close the socket.

 COVID-19, as an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has now been detected in more than 100 locations internationally.
 During the COVID-19 outbreak,especially in the face of a virus with which the general public may be unfamiliar, the majority to be told to isolate
 for up to the end of the outbreak,even they do not show any Covid-19 symptoms .As a student which
 studying for a graduate degree in biomedicine,I learnt a lot and had many feelings during this period and then I elaborated one by one.

COVID-19, as a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has now been detected in more than 100 locations
internationally.During the COVID-19 outbreak,especially be faced with a virus which the general public are unfamiliar,
the majority to be told to isolate,even they do not show any Covid-19 symptoms .As a student which
 studying for a graduate degree in biology,I had many feelings during this period and then I will elaborate them.

 To start,I learnt that Chinese scientists are conducting research to help provide timely analysis of the epidemic situation and
 support to formulate targeted strategies for the prevention.In view of the accelerated spread of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, we should
 understand the rule of its transmission as soon as possible, which is important for epidemic prevention .
 I realized that developing basic subjects can effectively treat diseases.Every advance we make in my profession will lay the
 foundation for the situation we are facing.

Secondly,I realized the significance of staying emotionally healthy.It’s natural to experience stress and
anxiety in the face of a threat we cannot control.At the preliminary stage of the outbreak, I becamed particularly confused, scared and angry .The mood improved over the next few days.
We don’t know with full certainty how contagious the virus is. Though we has reported many progress, research is still preliminary ,
the lack of knowledge is a major influencer on concern.I really don't want this outbreak to happen again.The most important insight during
this outbreak is that the most beautiful thing is safe and sound.

Finally,I remembered there is such a picture that I can't help crying.A couple in the hospital could not recognize each other
because they were wearing isolation suits.There are tens of thousands of white clad angels
like them, give up their peaceful life and fight day and night.They are all worthy of our praise and respect.When we have feelings
of powerlessness during the coronavirus outbreak,doctors used their sense of responsibility to tide us over.
At last, I just want to say :'Be strong,China !'
