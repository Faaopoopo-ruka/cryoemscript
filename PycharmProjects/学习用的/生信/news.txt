E7820.(a) Monodisperse peak of the complex by gel filtration. The red bar indicates the fraction used for the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel, shown to the right of the trace. Gel filtration of the complex was repeated at least three times with similar results. (b) Reference-free 2D class averages. The class average highlighted with a green box has signal for the three p-propellers of DDBI and DCAF15, however only B-propellers A and C of DDBl(outlined with a white hatched line)are aligned well, due to the inherent flexibility of DDBl B-propeller B and DCAF15 (c)Representative cryo-EM micrograph at-2.3 um defocus Scale bar indicates 20 nm.
Data collection was performed one time on this sample. (d)Recor highlighting the density for DDBl B-propeller A, DDBl B-propeller C, and DCAF15 at an average resolution of 10 A. (e)The DDBlAB-DCAF15-DDA1-RBM39RRM2 complex bound to E7820 complex displays a monodisperse gel filtration peak after BS3 cross-linking. The higher molecular weight cross-linked complex(180 kDa)is indicated on the SDS-PAGe gel to the right. Cross-linking and gel filtration of this complex was performed at least three times with similar results. (f) Representative micrograph of the DDAl-containing complex imaged with a Volta phase plate(VPP)at-1.I um defocus Scale bar represents 20 nm. Data collection was erformed on this complex from two independent grids over the course of four imaging sessions
(g)Reference-free 2D class averages. (h)Data processing scheme for the crosslinked DDBIAB-
DCAF15-DDAl-E7820-RBM39RRM2 complex Initial 2D and 3D classification resulted
923, 678 particles for Ctf Refinement and Bayesian polishing. Three subsequ ds of 3D lassification and refinement improved map resolution to a final average resolution of 4.4 A Percentages refer to the particles in each class. Red density maps indicate the classes that were used for the next round of processing, while blue density maps are from 3D refinements
