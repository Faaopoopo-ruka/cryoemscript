Protein expression and purification
COMPASS subunits were PCR amplified from K. lactis genomic DNA and subcloned into modified pFastBac vectors for expression in insect cells. Recombinant viruses were produced as per manufacturer instructions, and subsequently amplified in Sf9 monolayer cells to generate high titer viruses for protein expression in HighFive monolayer cells. Purification of the COMPASS subomplexes and mutants were done as previously described (Hsu et al., 2018).

Nucleosome reconstitution
Individual histones and the H3K4M mutant were expressed individually in BL21 DE3, and harvested 18 hours post-induction. Histone octamers were reconstituted using the “one-pot” refolding method as previously described (Lee et al., 2015). The 601-147 bp DNA sequence was excised from a plasmid containing 20 repeats of the sequence (McGinty et al., 2016). The plasmid backbone was removed using PEG precipitation, and the 147 insert was further purified by anion exchange chromatography, followed by desalting into TE buffer. Small scale titrations were done to determine a 1:1 DNA:histone ratio, followed up by a large scale dialysis to form nucleosomes (Dyer et al., 2004). Nucleosomes (WT and H3K4M) were stored at 4°C and used within a week of formation.

H2Bub-nucleosome reconstitution
Individual Xenopus histones, including the H3K4M and H2B K120C mutants, were purchased from the Protein Expression and Purification facility at Colorado State University (https://www.histonesource.com) as lyophilized powders. Ub G76C was expressed in BL21 DE3, and purified using a combination of acid precipitation followed by cation exchange chromatography. Purified Ub G76C was then dialyzed into water, and lyophilized for future use.

Generation of H2Bub was done essentially as previously described (Chatterjee et al., 2010). In brief, DTNP (2.0 mg, 6.45 mmol) was dissolved in 500 μL of a 3:1 (v/v) acetic acid:water mixture and added to H2B K120C (3 mg, 0.22 μmol). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 12 h at 25°C, prior to purification by C4 semi-preparative RP-HPLC with a 30%–70% B gradient. This yielded 2.1 mg (68.4%) of the pure H2B K120C-5-nitro-2-pyridinesulfenyl (pNpys) disulfide adduct. The identity of the disulfide adduct was verified by ESI-MS (expected: 13,622 Da, observed: 13,623 ± 3 Da). The product was then lyophilized for subsequent Ub ligation.

1 equivalent of the lyophilzed H2B-pNpys adduct (1.5 mg, 0.108 μmol) and 2.1 equivalents of Ub G76C (2.0 mg, 0.232 μmol) were dissolved in 625 μL of reaction buffer consisting of 1M HEPES, 6 M Gn-HCl, pH 6.9. Reaction was allowed for 1 h at 25°C with continuous shaking. The reaction products were purified by C4 semi-preparative HPLC with a 30%–70% B gradient to yield H2Bub (1.2 mg, 74%). The identity of the disulfide adduct was verified by ESI-MS (expected: 22,081 Da, observed: 22,083 ± 2 Da). The H2Bub product was then lyophilized and stored at −80°C for histone octamer reconstitution.

H2Bub-containing octamers were assembled using the salt dialysis method (Dyer et al., 2004) and purified over a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 2 M NaCl. Peak fractions were pooled and stored at −80°C for future use. H2Bub-nucleosomes were reconstituted as described for unmodified nucleosomes.

COMPASS-nucleosome complex reconstitution
Purified COMPASS eCM subcomplex were added to 4-fold excess to NCP/uNCP, and allowed to mix at room temperature for 30 minutes before injection on to a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.05 mM SAM (NEB). Peak fractions were collected, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and pooled. The complex was concentrated to 5 mg/mL, flash frozen, and stored at −80°C for future use.

Preformed COMPASS eCM-nucleosome complexes were incubated with 0.1% (v/v) gluteraldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature, and then quenched with the addition of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5. Crosslinked complexes were then injected on to a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.05 mM SAM (NEB). Peak fractions were analyzed by negative stain electron microscopy, and the best fractions were pooled and concentrated to 0.6 mg/mL, and stored at −80°C for future grid preparation.
Recombinant AdnAB proteins. Wild-type AdnAB heterodimer and mutant heterodime AdnA(D934A)-AdnB(D1014A)( dual nuclease-inactive mutant), AdnA(D255A)-AdnB(A motor domain motif Il mutant), and AdnA-AdnB (W325A-R326A)(B motor domain motif Ill mutant were produced in E coli by co-expression of His1o-Smt3-tagged AdnA and un-tagged AdnB subunits as described previously(1). All purification steps were performed at 4C. Soluble extracts of 2-
liter bacterial cultures were prepared by suspending the frozen and thawed cell pellet in 30 ml lysis buffer(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% sucrose, 250 mM NaCI), sonicating the suspension on ice for 10 min, and then removing insoluble material by centrifugation for 1 h at 16000 rpm. The resulting supernatants were applied to 10 ml columns of nickel-NTA resin(Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with lysis buffer. The columns were washed with lysis buffer and then eluted stepwise with 20, 100, 300, and 1000 mM imidazole in buffer A(50 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl
10% glycerol). The polypeptide compositions of the eluate fractions were monitored by SDS-
PAGE. Recombinant AdnAB was recovered predominantly in 300 mM imidazole eluate. The His1o Smt3 tag was removed from AdnAB by treatment with the Smt3-specific protease Ulp1(at a AdnAB: Ulp1 ratio of -500: 1) during overnight dialysis against buffer A containing 20 mM imidazole. The tag- free Adn AB was separated from the tag by passage over a second nickel-NTA agarose column equilibrated in 20 mM imidazole in buffer A AdnAB was recovered in the flow-
through fraction. The protein concentrations were determined by using the biorad dye reagen with bsa as the standard
Cloning and mutagenesis
PilT4 from G. metallireducens GS-15 was PCR amplified from genomic DNA by using primers P168 and P169 (Supplementary Table 2), digested with NdeI and XhoI, and cloned into pET28a with a thrombin-cleavable hexahistadine tag to create pET28a:PilTGm. PilT from P. aeruginosa PAO1 was PCR amplified from genomic DNA by using primers P220 and P221, digested with KpnI and XbaI, and cloned into pBADGr for arabinose-inducible expression to create pBADGr:PilTPa. pKT25::PilTPa and pBADGr:PilTPa were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis (Quikchange II, Agilent) to generate E204A, H229A, R239A, E219K, D31K, E258A, R294E, D242K, T216R, R123D, K58A, K58Q, and K58R mutants by using the eponymously named primers (Supplementary Table 2). Plasmid sequences were verified by TCAG sequencing facilities (The Hospital for Sick Children, Canada).

Expression and purification
E. coli BL21-CodonPlus® cells (Strategene, Supplementary Table 2) were transformed with pET28a:PilTGm, pET28a:PilTPa, or pET28a:PilBGm and grown in 4 L of lysogeny broth (LB) with 100 µg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5–0.6, then protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mM, and the cells were grown for 16 h at 18 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 9000 × g for 15 min. Cell pellets were subsequently resuspended in 40 ml of binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7, 150 mM NaCl, and 15 mM imidazole). Subsequent to crystallization of methylated OCOCOC PilT, the buffer was optimized to improve PilTGm thermostability — the pH was increased, HEPES was used instead of Tris, the concentration of NaCl was increased, and glycerol was added; hereafter the binding buffer for PilTGm was 50 mM HEPES, pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 15 mM imidazole. For PilBGm, cell pellets were resuspended in 40 ml of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 50 mM imidazole. For PilTPa, cell pellets were resuspended in 40 ml of 100 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM citrate, 150 mM (NH4)2SO4, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM MgSO4, and 50 mM imidazole. After resuspension in binding buffer, the cells were lysed by passage through an Emulsiflex-c3 high-pressure homogenizer, and the cell debris removed by centrifugation for 45 min at 40000 × g. The resulting supernatant was passed over a column containing 5 ml of pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA agarose resin (Life Technologies, USA). The resin was washed with ten column volumes of binding buffer and eluted over a gradient of binding buffer to binding buffer plus 600 mM imidazole. Purified PilTGm was additionally purified with a HP anion exchange column pre-equilibrated with binding buffer; the flow-through contained PilTGm. PilTGm, PilTPa, or PilBGm was then further purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a HiLoadTM 16/600 SuperdexTM 200-pg column pre-equilibrated with binding buffer without imidazole or glycerol. For the OCOCOC PilT structure with full-occupancy ADP, 2 mM ATP and 2 mM MgCl2 were added just prior to size-exclusion chromatography. For the crystallization of methylated OCOCOC PilT, the size-exclusion chromatography buffer was 50 mM HEPES, pH 7, 150 mM NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol, and subsequent to purification PilTGm was reductively methylated overnight (Reductive Alkylation Kit, Hampton Research), quenched with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7, and the size- exclusion chromatography step was repeated. All purified proteins were used immediately.

Expression and purification were performed as previously described for the ORC complex with an additional Strep Il affinity-tag purification step to ensure that the purified ORC
complex did not contain endogenous, wild type Orc6. Following calmodulin affinity purification, peak fractions containing Al19 were incubated with Strep-tactin Superflow high-
capacity resin(IBA)at 4C. The resin was washed with 10 CV binding buffer(25 mM HEPES-
KOH PH7.6, 0.05%NP-40, 10% glycerol, 0. IM KCl, 2 mM B-mercaptoethanol), before elution from the resin with binding buffer 5 mM biotin, Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated for further purification by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200
column(GE Healthcare). Peak fractions containing Al19 were pooled and concentrated before being frozen and stored at-80oC Histone Octamer Histones were co-expressed in bacteria and purified as a soluble octamer as described. Purified histone octamers were stored at -80C in 50% glycerol. Glycerol was removed by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column( GE Healthcare) prior to use for nucleosome reconstitution DNA templates Two sets of DNA templates were designed to contain the S cerevisiae ARS origin o replication, flanked either by native yeast genomic sequence or widom 601 and 603
nucleosome positioning sequen
Origin preparation Nucleosome assembly Soluble histone octamers were assembled into nucleosomes on origin templates 1-3 by salt deposition. Purified octamers were mixed with origin DNA in refolding buffer A(20 mM HEPES PH 7.6, 2 M NaCl, 5 mM B-mercaptoethanol) and diluted to a DNA concentration of
0.5-0.7 mg ml-I DNA. The samples were dialysed overnight against 100 ml of refolding buffer a that was gradually supplemented with 1.9 L of refolding buffer B (20 mM HEPES PH 7.6,

Yeast strains and growth conditions
All yeast strains used in this study are listed in Key Resources Table and are derivatives of BY4741. For strain construction, standard genetic techniques were employed (Janke et al., 2004, Knop et al., 1999, Storici and Resnick, 2006). All yeast strains were verified by DNA sequencing, western blotting for protein expression, and were shown to be competent for Fbp1 degradation (see below).

Unless otherwise specified, for assays described here, yeast strains were grown to OD600 of 1.0 in synthetic complete (SC) medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, plus a mixture of amino acids). If strains were carrying a plasmid, the appropriate amino acids were omitted. Cells were then centrifuged at 1900xg for 3 minutes, washed once with SE medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% ethanol, plus a mixture of amino acids), and then resuspended in fresh, pre-warmed SE media to an OD600 of 1.0. Cells were grown at 30°C for 19 hours, at which point they were harvested by centrifugation at 1,900xg for 3 minutes, and resuspended to an OD600 of 1.0 in fresh SC medium. At the indicated time points, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 11,200xg for 2 minutes, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for later analysis.

For growth under heat shock conditions, cells were grown in YPD at 30°C to mid-log phase and then shifted to 42°C for 30 minutes, before returning the cultures to 30°C growth. For growth under high salinity conditions, cells were grown to mid-log phase in YPD, then pelleted and resuspended in fresh YPD + 0.5 M NaCl and allow to grow at 30°C. At the indicated time points, an aliquot of cells was harvested by centrifugation.

Fbp1 degradation assays
Fbp1 degradation assays were carried out using the promoter reference technique as previously described (Oh et al., 2017). Briefly, cells were first transformed with a plasmid co-expressing Fbp1 and a control protein (DHFR) from identical promoters containing an element that once transcribed binds tetracycline to inhibit translation. After growth for 19 hours in medium containing 2% ethanol, cells were resuspended to an OD600 of 1.0 in SD medium lacking the appropriate amino acids and containing 2% glucose and 0.5 mM tetracycline. At the indicated time points, 1 OD600 equivalent of cells were harvested. Cells were lysed by resuspension in 0.2 M NaOH followed by incubation on ice for 20 minutes, and then pelleted by centrifugation at 11,200xg for 2 minutes. The supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was resuspended in HU buffer containing 1X complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche), heated at 70°C for 10 minutes, and then the resulting lysate was precleared by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 11,200xg. Samples were loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, followed by analysis by western blotting. Blots were imaged on a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare) and bands were quantified using ImageStudio software (Li-Cor). At each time point, the amount of Fbp1 was normalized to the DHFR control protein.

Affinity Enrichment Mass Spectrometry (AE-MS)
Experiments were carried out in triplicates and as previously described (Keilhauer et al., 2015). 50 OD600 of yeast were resuspended in buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche), PhosStop tablets (Roche), 5% Glycerol, 1% NP-40, and 1% Benzonase. Cells were lysed by glass bead lysis in a FastPrep-24 instrument (MP Biomedicals) during three rounds of 20 s each at a speed of 4.0 M/s. Lysates were then pre-cleared by centrifugation at 4,000xg for 10 minutes. FLAG-tagged protein was then pulled-down using anti-DYKDDDDK magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech). After applying the beads to the magnetic columns, beads were washed three times with wash buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.05% NP-40, and 5% Glycerol, followed by two washes in buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, and 5% Glycerol. Bound proteins were then partially digested by addition of 25 μL of elution buffer I containing 5 ng/μL Trypsin, 2 M Urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, and 1 mM DTT. After incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature, the proteins were eluted from the column by elution with 2x50 μL of buffer containing 2 M Urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, and 5 mM CAA. Samples were then incubated overnight at room temperature to ensure complete tryptic digestion. Next day, protease activity was quenched by acidification with Trifluoracetic acid to a final concentration of 1%. Samples were processed as described in ‘LC-MS/MS sample preparation’.

Protein digestion of in vitro ubiquitylation assays
Protein concentrations of the samples from in vitro ubiquitylation assays were measured by Bradford assay (BioRad). 4 μg of samples were 4-fold diluted in digestion buffer (1 M Urea in 50 mM Ammonium Bicarbonate, pH 8.0) followed by addition of TCEP and CAA to a final concentration of 10 mM and 40 mM, respectively, for reduction and alkylation for 5 min at 45°C. The samples were either digested using Trypsin (1:20 w/w, Sigma-Aldrich) alone, Trypsin (1:40 w/w)/GluC (1:40 w/w, BioLab) or Trypsin (1:40 w/w)/AspN (1:40 w/w, Promega) at 37°C overnight. In all cases, protease activity was quenched by acidification with Trifluoracetic acid to a final concentration of 1%.

LC-MS/MS sample preparation
Acidified samples were loaded onto SDB-RPS StageTips, pre-equilibrated with 30% Methanol /1% Trifluoracetic acid and washed with 0.2% Trifluoracetic acid. StageTips were prepared by inserting two layers of SDB-RPS matrix (Empore) into a 200 μL pipette tip using an in-house prepared syringe device as described previously (Kulak et al., 2014). The StageTips were centrifuged at 1000xg. Loaded samples were sequentially washed with 0.2% Trifluoracetic acid and 2% Acetonitrile/0.2% Trifluoracetic acid, followed by elution with 1.25% NH4OH/80% Acetonitrile. Eluates were dried using a SpeedVac centrifuge (Eppendorf, Concentrator plus). Peptides were resuspended in buffer A∗ (2% Acetonitrile /0.1% Trifluoracetic acid) and briefly sonicated (Branson Ultrasonics) before LC/MS-MS analysis.

LC-MS/MS Measurements
For mapping ubiquitylation sites, peptide concentration was estimated by UV spectrometry and approximately 200 ng was loaded on a 50 cm reversed phase column (75 μm inner diameter, packed in house with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 μm resin [Dr. Maisch GmbH]). Column temperature was maintained at 60°C using a homemade column oven. Peptides were separated with a binary buffer system of buffer A (0.1% Formic acid (FA)) and buffer B (80% Acetonitrile plus 0.1% FA), at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. We used an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which was directly coupled online with the mass spectrometer (Q Excative HF-X, Thermo Fisher Scientific) via a nano-electrospray source. Peptides were eluted with a gradient starting at 3% buffer B and stepwise increased to 8% in 8 min, 36% in 32 min, 45% in 4 min and 95% in 4 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in Top12 data-dependent mode (DDA) with a full scan range of 250-1350 m/z at 60,000 resolution with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3e6 and a maximum fill time of 20ms. Precursor ions were isolated with a width of 1.4 m/z and fragmented by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 28%. Fragment scans were performed at a resolution of 30,000, an AGC of 1e5 and a maximum injection time of 110ms. Dynamic exclusion was enabled and set to 15 s.

For AE-MS samples, peptides were loaded on a 50 cm reversed phase column (75 μm inner diameter, packed in house with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 μm resin [Dr. Maisch GmbH]). Column temperature was maintained at 60°C using a homemade column oven. Peptides were separated with a binary buffer system of buffer A (0.1% Formic acid (FA)) and buffer B (80% Acetonitrile plus 0.1% FA), at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. We used an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which was directly coupled online with the mass spectrometer (Q Excative HF-X, Thermo Fisher Scientific) via a nano-electrospray source. Peptides were eluted with a gradient starting at 5% buffer B and stepwise increased to 30% in 40 min, 60% in 4 min and 95% in 4 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in Top12 data-dependent mode (DDA) with a full scan range of 300-1650 m/z at 60,000 resolution with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3e6 and a maximum fill time of 20ms. Precursor ions were isolated with a width of 1.4 m/z and fragmented by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 27%. Fragment scans were performed at a resolution of 15,000, an AGC of 1e5 and a maximum injection time of 60ms. Dynamic exclusion was enabled and set to 30 s.

LC-MS/MS raw data processing
For mapping ubiquitylation sites, raw MS data were searched against the UniProt Yeast FASTA using MaxQuant (version 1.6.2.10) (Cox and Mann, 2008, Cox et al., 2011) with a 1% FDR at peptide and protein level. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fixed, protein N-Terminal acetylation, methionine oxidation and lysine diGly as variable modifications. The minimum peptide length was set to 7 amino acids, enzyme specificity was set to trypsin and two missed cleavages were allowed, permitting a maximum of 5 modifications per peptide. MS/MS spectra identifying ubiquitinated peptides of interest were obtained and exported using MaxQuant Viewer (Tyanova et al., 2015).

For AE-MS runs, raw MS data were searched against the UniProt Yeast FASTA using MaxQuant (version 1.6.0.15)(Cox and Mann, 2008, Cox et al., 2011) with a 1% FDR at peptide and protein level. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fixed, protein N-Terminal acetylation, methionine oxidation. The minimum peptide length was set to 7 amino acids, enzyme specificity was set to trypsin and two missed cleavages were allowed, permitting a maximum of 5 modifications per peptide. Quantification was performed by label free quantification (MaxLFQ), with a minimum ratio count of 2. ‘Match between runs’ was enabled, with a matching time window of 0.7 min(Cox et al., 2014). Bioinformatic analyses were performed with Perseus (www.perseus-framework.org) (Tyanova et al., 2016). Missing data points were replaced by data imputation (width: 0.3 and shift: 1.8) after filtering for valid values (100% data completeness in at least one experimental group). Significance was assessed using t test (5% FDR), for which replicates were grouped.

Density Fractionation by sucrose gradients
At the indicated time points, 100 OD600 equivalents were harvested by centrifugation at 1900xg for 3 minutes. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1% NP-40, and protease inhibitors (Roche), and lysed by glass bead lysis using a FastPrep-24 (MP Biomedicals). The resulting lysate was pre-cleared by centrifugation at 4,000xg for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was normalized by Bradford for total protein content, loaded onto a 5%–40% sucrose gradient, and centrifuged at 34,300 rpm for 16 hours at 4°C. Each gradient was harvested into fourteen equal fractions, and run on SDS-PAGE, followed by analysis by western blotting with the appropriate antibody. Approximate molecular weights for fractions were determined using the protein standards provided with Gel Filtration Calibration Kit HMW (GE Healthcare). Briefly, 2 mg of each protein standard were resuspended in lysis buffer and run on a 5%–40% gradient as described above.

Plasmids preparation and Mutagenesis
Genes encoding GID subunits and Mdh2 substrate were originally amplified using S. cerevisiae BY4742 genomic DNA as a template. Upon initiating functional studies, we noticed that all sequences except Gid5 match those in the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), where the Gid5 sequence corresponds to accession number NP_012247. The sequence of Gid5 used in the structure corresponds to accession number AJR43361 from the strain YJM1133. The difference is a single Gid5 Y758N residue substitution. We tested the functionality of the sequence used in the structure in initial assays probing GIDSR4 activity toward Mdh2, and we confirmed by cryo EM that the overall structures of GIDSR4 are similar with the two versions of Gid5. We converted to the SGD sequence for functional studies.

The genes encoding GID subunits were combined into one baculoviral expression vector with the biGBac method (Weissmann et al., 2016). All the plasmids used in this study are listed in the Key Resources Table.

The constructs for recombinant protein expression were generated by Gibson assembly method (Gibson et al., 2009) with a home-made Gibson reaction mix. To generate all the mutant versions of the constructs, QuickChange (Stratagene) protocol was applied. All coding sequences used for protein expression were entirely verified by sequencing.

Protein expression and purification for cryo-EM
GID complexes and all the subcomplexes used for the single particle cryo EM analysis (GIDSR4, GIDAnt, GIDScaffold plus substrate receptor Gid4 (SRGid4), GIDScaffold plus substrate receptor Gid10 (SRGid10), GIDSR4 minus Gid2/ΔGid9RING, GIDSR4 ΔRINGs), were expressed in insect cell. For protein expression, Hi5 insect cells were transfected with recombinant baculovirus variants carrying the respective protein coding sequences and grown for 60 hours to 72 hours in EX-CELL 420 Serum-Free Medium at 27°C.

Cell pellets were resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mM benzamidine, EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (1 tablet per 50 mL of the buffer) and 1 mM PMSF. The tagged complexes were purified from cell lysates by Strep-Tactin affinity chromatography by pulling on the Twin-Strep tag fused at the Gid1 N terminus. Elutions were further purified by anion exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography in 25 mM MES pH 6.5, 500 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT.

For endogenous GIDAnt purification, yeast strain CRLY45 harboring 3X Flag tag at the C terminus of Gid8 was grown in the YPD medium at 30°C and 130 rpm to an OD600 of 1. Yeast cells were spun down and rinsed with YP medium to remove the remaining glucose. The pellet was resuspended with YPE medium and grown at 30°C and 130 rpm for 16-19 hours. Next, cell pellets were passed through a 50 mL syringe, to get thin noodle-like pellets and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen yeast noodles were cryomilled using Retsch ZM200 Ultra Centrifugal Mill. Powder was dissolved in the lysis buffer described above. GID complex was purified from the cell lysate by Flag affinity chromatography (Anti-DYKDDDDK G1 resin, GenScript). The resin bound GID complex was washed with 25 mM MES pH 6.5, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and protein was eluted with 150 μg/ml Flag peptide. The elutions were directly used to make the cryo EM grids.
